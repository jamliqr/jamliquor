# Task ID: 9
# Title: Optimize performance for edge hardware
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Fine-tune the implementation for target edge platforms
# Details:
Optimize the codebase for performance on edge hardware. Implement memory-efficient data structures and algorithms. Reduce CPU usage in critical paths. Optimize for the specific architectures of target platforms (RISC-V, ARM). Achieve the performance goals of 6s block time and 18s finality on edge hardware.

# Test Strategy:
Benchmark performance on all target platforms (Milk-V Duo, Pine64 Ox64, Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, StarFive VisionFive 2). Measure memory usage, CPU utilization, block time, and finality time. Compare against performance requirements and optimize further if needed.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Profile codebase to identify performance bottlenecks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a performance baseline and identify critical bottlenecks on target edge hardware
### Details:
Set up profiling tools for RISC-V and ARM architectures. Run comprehensive benchmarks to measure current performance metrics including CPU usage, memory consumption, and timing for block creation and finality. Create detailed performance reports highlighting the top 5-10 bottlenecks. Focus on measuring the current block time and finality duration against the 6s and 18s targets. Document findings in a performance analysis report with specific recommendations for optimization targets.

## 2. Implement memory-efficient data structures [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Redesign key data structures to minimize memory footprint on edge devices
### Details:
Based on profiling results, identify data structures with high memory usage. Replace standard containers with custom implementations optimized for the specific use cases. Consider techniques like memory pooling, compact representations, and zero-copy approaches. Implement custom serialization/deserialization routines if needed. Focus on reducing heap allocations and memory fragmentation. Validate each optimization with before/after memory measurements on target hardware.

## 3. Optimize critical path algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Refactor performance-critical algorithms to reduce CPU usage and execution time
### Details:
Refactor the algorithms identified in the critical path during profiling. Apply algorithm-specific optimizations such as reducing computational complexity, eliminating redundant calculations, and implementing caching strategies. Consider hardware-specific optimizations like loop unrolling and SIMD instructions where applicable. Focus particularly on consensus and validation algorithms that impact block time and finality. Measure performance impact of each optimization and document the improvements.

## 4. Implement architecture-specific optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Add platform-specific code paths for RISC-V and ARM architectures
### Details:
Create specialized code paths that leverage unique features of RISC-V and ARM architectures. Implement assembly-optimized versions of performance-critical functions. Utilize architecture-specific intrinsics and compiler directives. Configure build system to detect target architecture and select appropriate optimizations. Test each optimization on actual target hardware. Consider creating a hardware abstraction layer to manage architecture-specific implementations while maintaining clean code organization.

## 5. Validate and fine-tune performance targets [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.4
### Description: Verify performance goals are met and perform final optimizations to achieve 6s block time and 18s finality
### Details:
Run comprehensive benchmarks on target edge hardware to verify performance against the 6s block time and 18s finality goals. Identify any remaining gaps between current and target performance. Implement final fine-tuning optimizations to close these gaps. Create performance regression tests to ensure optimizations are maintained in future development. Document all optimizations applied, their impact, and any trade-offs made. Prepare a final performance report comparing initial and final metrics across different edge hardware configurations.
