# 🤖 AI.md — Adaptability Through Inference

## 🔁 Principle: Adaptability Through Inference

> Static systems break. Adaptive systems evolve.

JamLiquor is engineered to be **contextually aware**, able to **optimize, react, and learn** from its environment using lightweight AI inference. This transforms it from a passive executor into a **self-regulating, intelligent node**.

---

## 🧠 Why AI in Blockchain?
Traditional blockchain nodes:
- Follow static logic
- Require manual tuning
- Cannot respond autonomously to network or external changes

JamLiquor changes that by integrating AI-powered inference for:
- ✅ Smart contract execution logic
- ✅ Validator behavior
- ✅ Resource optimization
- ✅ Real-time anomaly detection

---

## 🧩 Where AI Lives in JamLiquor

### 1. **Smart Contract Execution (Inference-Enabled Logic)**
- Contracts can make decisions based on external inputs or network telemetry
- Uses embedded models (e.g., logistic regression, tiny CNNs) via [TinyML](https://www.tinyml.org/)

Example:
```rust
// Contract that adjusts fee dynamically based on predicted congestion
env::set_fee(infer::predict_gas_price(inputs));
```

### 2. **Validator Intelligence**
- Nodes use inference to:
  - Detect abnormal validator activity
  - Adapt staking weights
  - Trigger auto-safeguards (e.g., rotate keys, isolate peers)

### 3. **Local Optimization on Edge**
- Inference models help low-power nodes:
  - Tune gas limits
  - Manage memory during peak load
  - Reduce redundant computation

## 🔍 Architecture Overview

Module: `jamliquor-ai`
- `inference.rs`: Load & execute quantized models
- `signals.rs`: Wrap telemetry and input extraction
- `contract_hooks.rs`: JAM runtime extensions for smart contracts to use inference

All AI models are:
- Quantized to ≤32KB
- Stateless by default
- Executed deterministically (no external randomness)

## 🔬 Model Types and Tools
JamLiquor uses minimal AI models that run without GPUs or cloud inference:

| Model Type | Use Case                          | Size     | Engine         |
|------------|-----------------------------------|----------|----------------|
| Logistic Regression | Binary flag detection               | ~1KB     | TinyML, ndarray |
| Decision Trees       | Threshold rules & routing           | ~5–10KB | `linfa-tree`     |
| Tiny CNN             | Pattern recognition (e.g. logs)     | ~32KB    | `micro-tflite`   |

---

## 🔄 Sample Use Cases

### 🟢 Adaptive Gas Pricing
Contract reads mempool congestion → predicts optimal gas → sets accordingly.

### 🔐 Slashing Protection
Validator uses inference on peer behavior to detect equivocation or downtime trends.

### 🌡 IoT-Integrated Smart Contracts
Sensor data (e.g., temperature) processed locally via TinyML → triggers JAM contract if threshold breached.

## ⚠️ Limitations & Safety
- ❗ Models are non-learning at runtime (inference only)
- ❗ AI modules are optional and modular (not consensus-critical)
- ✅ All predictions are traceable and revertible

> AI adds adaptability—but never overrides determinism.

## ✅ Conclusion
JamLiquor makes blockchain **intelligent at the edge**:
- 🔄 Smart contracts adapt
- 🧠 Validators evolve
- ⚡ Efficiency increases

**Inference brings awareness. Awareness brings resilience.**
