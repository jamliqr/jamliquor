# Task ID: 1
# Title: Set up project foundation and architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the JamLiquor project with basic structure, dependencies, and architectural scaffolding
# Details:
Create a new Rust project with cargo, set up the recommended Rust version (1.70+), establish module structure for core components (Importer, Authorer, PolkaVM Backend, Extensions), configure build targets for RISC-V and ARM architectures, set up testing framework, and create documentation structure. Include configuration for the cleanroom development approach with public commit history.

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully on different target platforms. Ensure all module interfaces are properly defined. Create unit tests for basic architectural components.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Rust project with cargo and version configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the base JamLiquor project structure with proper Rust version pinning and initial configuration files
### Details:
Run `cargo init --name jamliquor` to create the project. Add a `rust-toolchain.toml` file to specify Rust 1.70+ as the required version. Create a `.gitignore` file with appropriate Rust patterns. Initialize Git repository with `git init` and make an initial commit. Add a basic README.md with project overview and development approach documentation. Set up GitHub Actions for CI with a basic workflow file that runs tests and checks formatting.

## 2. Establish core module structure and dependency management [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Define the initial module structure for the project and add essential dependencies
### Details:
Create the initial module structure in `src/` with placeholder files for core components: `importer.rs`, `authorer.rs`, `polkavm_backend.rs`, and `extensions.rs`. Create a basic `lib.rs` that exports these modules. Update Cargo.toml with essential dependencies including: polkavm (for VM integration), clap (for CLI), serde (for serialization), and appropriate testing frameworks. Document the module structure in the README.md. Set up feature flags for optional components.

## 3. Configure build targets for RISC-V and ARM architectures [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up cross-compilation support for target architectures
### Details:
Create a `.cargo/config.toml` file to define build targets for RISC-V and ARM. Add cross-compilation tools as dev-dependencies. Document the build process for each target architecture. Create build scripts if needed for platform-specific configurations. Test the build process for each target to ensure it works correctly. Add CI steps to verify cross-compilation. Document any platform-specific considerations in a BUILDING.md file.

## 4. Implement testing framework and initial tests [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up comprehensive testing infrastructure for the project
### Details:
Create a `tests/` directory with integration test files. Set up unit tests in each module file. Add test utilities in a `tests/common/` module. Configure test-specific dependencies in Cargo.toml. Implement basic smoke tests for each core component. Set up property-based testing with proptest if appropriate. Create a test documentation file explaining the testing approach. Ensure tests run in CI pipeline.

## 5. Create documentation structure and development guidelines [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Establish comprehensive documentation for the project including architecture and contribution guidelines
### Details:
Create a `docs/` directory with markdown files for: architecture overview, component design, API documentation, and development workflow. Set up rustdoc comments in code. Create CONTRIBUTING.md with guidelines for the cleanroom development approach. Document the public commit history requirements. Add architecture diagrams (using Mermaid or similar). Create examples directory with sample code. Set up documentation generation in CI. Add badges to README.md for build status and documentation links.
