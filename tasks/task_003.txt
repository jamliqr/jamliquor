# Task ID: 3
# Title: Develop Authorer module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the block production engine with SAFROLE and Ring VRF implementation
# Details:
Implement the Authorer module responsible for block production. Develop SAFROLE + Ring VRF implementation for consensus. Create the complete authoring pipeline including transaction selection, block assembly, and consensus integration. Implement randomness generation for the consensus mechanism.

# Test Strategy:
Test block production with various transaction scenarios. Verify SAFROLE + Ring VRF implementation against known test vectors. Measure block production time to ensure it meets the 6s block time requirement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement core Authorer module structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational structure of the Authorer module with basic interfaces and components
### Details:
Develop the core Authorer module structure including: 1) Define interfaces for block production components, 2) Create the module's main entry points and lifecycle hooks, 3) Implement basic configuration options and parameters, 4) Set up the module's state management, 5) Create logging and metrics infrastructure for the authoring process. This subtask establishes the foundation for all subsequent implementation work.

## 2. Implement Ring VRF cryptographic primitives [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Develop the Ring Verifiable Random Function cryptographic implementation
### Details:
Implement the Ring VRF cryptographic primitives: 1) Create the core Ring signature scheme with proper security parameters, 2) Implement the VRF functionality including proof generation and verification, 3) Develop key management for VRF operations, 4) Create test vectors and validation mechanisms, 5) Optimize the implementation for performance. This implementation will be used as a building block for the consensus mechanism.

## 3. Implement SAFROLE consensus mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2
### Description: Develop the SAFROLE consensus algorithm integrated with Ring VRF
### Details:
Implement the SAFROLE consensus mechanism: 1) Develop the leader election algorithm using Ring VRF, 2) Implement the block finalization rules, 3) Create the fork choice rule implementation, 4) Develop slashing conditions for validator misbehavior, 5) Implement the randomness beacon using Ring VRF outputs, 6) Create consensus state management. This subtask integrates the Ring VRF implementation with the SAFROLE consensus rules.

## 4. Implement transaction selection and block assembly [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create the transaction queue management and block building components
### Details:
Implement transaction selection and block assembly: 1) Develop the transaction queue with prioritization logic, 2) Implement transaction validation and filtering, 3) Create the block template builder with proper header construction, 4) Implement resource usage tracking and limits, 5) Develop the finalization mechanism for assembled blocks, 6) Create interfaces for external transaction sources. This subtask handles the data preparation aspects of block production.

## 5. Integrate authoring pipeline and implement production logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4
### Description: Connect all components into a complete block production pipeline with proper timing and triggers
### Details:
Integrate the complete authoring pipeline: 1) Implement the block production timing mechanism, 2) Create the state machine for the authoring process, 3) Develop the integration between consensus and block assembly, 4) Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms, 5) Create the network announcement logic for produced blocks, 6) Develop comprehensive testing for the entire pipeline, 7) Implement performance monitoring and optimization. This final subtask connects all previous components into a functioning block production system.
