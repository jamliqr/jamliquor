## üåü Core Principles
JamLiquor is built on five non-negotiable principles. Each one is documented in its own dedicated page:

> [!TIP] ‚ö° [Lightweight by Design](./EDGE.md)
> Efficient at the edge. Designed for minimalism without compromise.

> [!INFO] üåê [Real Decentralization](./DECENTRALIZATION.md)
> No central backdoors. No soft capture. Just real distributed infrastructure.

> [!NOTE] üß† [Adaptability Through Inference](./AI.md)
> Embedded AI for adaptive behavior ‚Äî edge-aware, context-smart.

> [!WARNING] üîê [Quantum Resistance](./PQC.md)
> Cryptography that outlives quantum threats. Built for a longer tomorrow.

> [!SUCCESS] üß± [Simplicity Is Strength](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
> Elegant, composable architecture. Complexity kills ‚Äî simplicity scales.
