# ⚠️ DISCLAIMER — This Is a Dream in Motion

> JamLiquor is an **experimental project**. Most of what you read here is bold, speculative, and not yet validated in production.

We are building:
- In a **sandbox**, not in battle-tested infrastructure
- With **belief**, not certainty
- Through **iteration**, not blueprints

---

## 🔬 What This Means
- Many concepts (edge execution, AI inference, PQC modularity) have not yet passed formal audits or rigorous research.
- This project evolves **in the open**, and you may encounter broken builds, failed assumptions, or shifting structures.
- We **expect failure**. We are building through it.

> If it works: credit belongs to the builders who dared to dream.
> If it fails: the lessons will shape what comes next.

We welcome contributors, skeptics, and dreamers alike.

**JamLiquor is not just code. It's a test of belief in the possible.**
