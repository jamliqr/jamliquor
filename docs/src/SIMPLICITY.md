# Simplicity is Strength

> **Status:** Design philosophy, still current in spirit. The concrete module list below (PolkaVM execution model, `extensions/`) is pre-pivot; the current plan is `jam-core`'s four modules — see [`spec.md`](../../spec.md) §6.

> Complexity is fragility. Simplicity is power.

JamLiquor is intentionally minimalist—not because we lack ambition, but because **trustless systems should be understandable**, extensible, and verifiable by anyone.

## Why Simplicity Matters in Blockchain

Modern blockchain stacks suffer from:
- 🌀 Recursive rollups
- 🧩 Layered bridges
- 🧠 Unverifiable ZK complexity
- 🛠 Inaccessible tooling for most developers

> If your blockchain needs a PhD to audit, it's not secure.

JamLiquor chooses another path:
- **1 runtime** (JAM-compatible)
- **1 execution model** (PolkaVM)
- **1 state tree** (unified JAM model)
- **Modular extensions** (not embedded complexity)

## Code Design Philosophy
JamLiquor follows:
- 🧠 **Rust-first ergonomics** (clear, type-safe interfaces)
- 🔍 **Modular crates**, no god-objects
- 📦 **Small units of code**, each ~<500 LOC
- 🧪 **Testable in isolation**, not just integrated

Every line is:
- Explicit
- Auditable
- Justified by JAM specs or clean extensions

## What We Avoid
- ❌ Recursive rollups
- ❌ Multi-layer fraud proofs
- ❌ Hidden gas accounting
- ❌ Hardcoded validators
- ❌ WASM-only obscurity

> Complexity is technical debt in disguise.

## Summary
JamLiquor is architected for simplicity:
- ✳️ Easy to audit
- ✳️ Easy to run
- ✳️ Easy to modify

It is not just a lab experiment. It's aiming to be a working node for humans.

**Simplicity scales. Simplicity survives.**
