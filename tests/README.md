# JamLiquor Testing Strategy

## Overview
Our testing approach focuses on comprehensive, multi-layered validation of the JamLiquor project.

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (`/tests/unit`)
- Validate individual functions and components
- Ensure isolated behavior of core modules
- High code coverage target: 90%

### Integration Tests (`/tests/integration`)
- Test interactions between modules
- Validate system-level behaviors
- Simulate real-world scenarios

### Fixtures (`/tests/fixtures`)
- Provide consistent test data
- Mock configurations and sample inputs
- Support reproducible testing

## Testing Tools
- Rust's built-in `cargo test`
- `proptest` for property-based testing
- `mockall` for mocking dependencies
- `rstest` for advanced test fixtures

## Best Practices
- Write tests before or alongside implementation
- Keep tests independent and idempotent
- Use descriptive test names
- Cover edge cases and failure modes

## Error Handling and Edge Cases
- Test boundary conditions (min/max values)
- Validate error propagation
- Test invalid input scenarios
- Ensure graceful failure modes
- Verify error messages are informative

## Coverage and Quality Metrics
- Target code coverage: 90%
- Continuous Integration (CI) checks:
  * Automated test runs on every PR
  * Code coverage reporting
  * Static code analysis
  * Dependency security scanning

## Performance Testing
- Benchmark critical path operations
- Profile memory and CPU usage
- Test scalability under load
- Identify potential bottlenecks

## Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run unit tests
cargo test --lib

# Run integration tests
cargo test --test integration

# Generate coverage report
cargo tarpaulin
```
