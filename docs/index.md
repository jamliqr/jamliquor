# 📚 JamLiquor Documentation Index

Welcome to the JamLiquor Docs — the living blueprint of a purpose-driven, JAM-compliant blockchain client designed for the edge, for adaptability, and for a post-quantum future.

## 🌟 Core Principles
JamLiquor is built on five non-negotiable principles. Each one is documented in its own dedicated page:

1. [Lightweight by Design](./EDGE.md)
2. [Real Decentralization, Not a Buzzword](./DECENTRALIZATION.md)
3. [Adaptability Through Inference](./AI.md)
4. [Quantum Resistance is Non-Negotiable](./PQC.md)
5. [Simplicity Is Strength](./ARCHITECTURE.md)

## 🛠 Project Overview
- [Manifesto (v0.2.0)](./MANIFESTO.md): The philosophical backbone
- [README](./README.md): Project setup, milestones, and architecture
- [Cleanroom Policy](./cleanroom.md): JAM Prize compatibility and auditability

## 🧪 Disclaimer: A Dream Under Construction
JamLiquor is a bold claim. It reads like an **engineering utopia**. Many may see it as naïve or speculative.

And they’re not wrong.

This work is:
- 🌱 Experimental
- 🧪 Untested at scale
- 🧩 Composed of speculative modules

But:
> **All real systems begin as dreams.**

JamLiquor is:
- 🚧 A sandbox of ideas and engineering
- 🔁 Built by iteration: brake, fail, fix, retry
- 🙋 In need of true believers who can build with us

We don’t promise it will work tomorrow. But we are building it every day to make it work.

If it works: the credit belongs to everyone who dared to try.  
If it fails: we’ll have learned more than most systems ever attempt.

This is not just software. It’s a belief in what’s possible.

**Welcome to JamLiquor. Let’s tinker toward something impossible.**
