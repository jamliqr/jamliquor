# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement core Importer module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the foundational Importer module for block verification and state transitions
# Details:
Implement JAM Protocol block validation logic, state transition functions, and CoreTime & validator judgment ruleset. Create data structures for the JAM Protocol Compliant State Transition Model. Ensure minimal memory usage to support edge hardware constraints. Implement verification of incoming blocks according to JAM specification.

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive unit tests for block validation and state transitions. Develop integration tests with mock blocks to verify correct behavior. Benchmark memory usage to ensure compliance with â‰¤128MB RAM requirement.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design JAM Protocol data structures [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational data structures needed for the JAM Protocol Compliant State Transition Model
### Details:
Define memory-efficient data structures for blocks, transactions, state objects, and validation results. Implement structs for CoreTime accounting and validator judgments. Ensure all data structures are optimized for minimal memory footprint to support edge hardware constraints. Document memory usage estimates for each structure. Include serialization/deserialization methods compatible with the JAM specification.

## 2. Implement block parsing and validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Create functions to parse incoming blocks and perform basic structural validation
### Details:
Develop functions to deserialize incoming block data according to JAM specification. Implement structural validation to verify block format, header integrity, and transaction inclusion proofs. Create error types for different validation failures. Ensure parsing is memory-efficient by using streaming approaches where possible. Add logging for validation steps to aid debugging.

## 3. Implement CoreTime verification logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Develop the verification system for CoreTime accounting within blocks
### Details:
Implement functions to verify CoreTime allocations and consumption within blocks. Create validation rules for CoreTime balance checks, allocation limits, and proper accounting. Develop tests with various CoreTime scenarios including edge cases. Ensure verification logic handles all CoreTime operations defined in the JAM specification. Optimize algorithms for minimal computational overhead.

## 4. Implement validator judgment verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Create the system to verify validator judgments and consensus rules
### Details:
Implement verification of validator signatures and judgment attestations. Create functions to check quorum requirements and voting thresholds according to JAM Protocol rules. Develop logic to handle different judgment types and their implications. Implement slashing condition detection for validator misbehavior. Ensure all verification steps are properly sequenced and optimized.

## 5. Implement state transition functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4
### Description: Develop the core state transition logic for applying validated blocks
### Details:
Create functions to apply validated blocks to the current state. Implement atomic state updates with rollback capability in case of failures. Develop optimized algorithms for state merkle tree updates. Ensure all state transitions follow the JAM Protocol rules. Implement memory-efficient differential state updates rather than full state copies where possible. Add comprehensive logging of state transitions for debugging and auditing.

## 6. Integrate components and optimize performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5
### Description: Connect all components into a cohesive Importer module and optimize for performance
### Details:
Create the main Importer interface that orchestrates the entire block import process. Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms. Perform memory and CPU profiling to identify bottlenecks. Optimize critical paths for performance while maintaining correctness. Implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data. Create comprehensive tests for the entire import flow including edge cases and error conditions. Document the module's API and internal architecture.
