## 🌟 Core Principles

JamLiquor is built on five non-negotiable principles. Each one is documented in its own dedicated page:

[⚡ Lightweight by Design](./EDGE.md)
Efficient at the edge. Designed for minimalism without compromise.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
[🌐 Real Decentralization](./DECENTRALIZATION.md)
No central backdoors. No soft capture. Just real distributed infrastructure.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
[🧠 Adaptability Through Inference](./AI.md)
Embedded AI for adaptive behavior — edge-aware, context-smart.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
[🔐 Quantum Resistance](./PQC.md)
Cryptography that outlives quantum threats. Built for a longer tomorrow.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
[🧱 Simplicity Is Strength](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
