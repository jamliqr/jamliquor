## üìå What is JamLiquor?

**JamLiquor** is a purpose-driven, cleanroom **JAM Protocol implementation**, engineered from scratch in Rust. It is designed to:

- ‚úÖ **Conform to JAM's execution model** and participate in the JAM ecosystem
- ‚úÖ **Run on edge hardware** like Milk-V Duo and Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W
- ‚úÖ **Support modular innovation**, including AI inference and PQ cryptography

JamLiquor is not a fork. It's not a derivative. It is a **JAM-native node with radical modularity**.

---

## üß≠ Core Principles

### 1. **Lightweight by Default**

Runs on ‚â§128MB RAM and ‚â§1GHz CPUs. JAM should live at the edge.

### 2. **Real Decentralization**

No validator elitism. JamLiquor is designed for community-run nodes.

### 3. **Adaptability with AI**

AI inference modules allow the node to adapt in real time‚Äîon-chain and off-chain.

### 4. **Quantum-Resistance First**

Includes opt-in modules for Dilithium, Kyber, and XMSS.

### 5. **Simplicity is Strength**

Minimalist, auditable, and modular. No unnecessary cryptographic gymnastics.

## üöÄ Join the Movement

JamLiquor is a JAM client with purpose.
Compliant by design. Modular by philosophy. Edge-ready by default.

**We don't fork the future. We build it.**

üß™ Disclaimer: A Dream Under Construction

JamLiquor is a bold claim. It reads like an engineering utopia. Many may see it as na√Øve or speculative.

And they're not wrong.

This work is:

üå± Experimental

üß™ Untested at scale

üß© Composed of speculative modules

But:

All real systems begin as dreams.

JamLiquor is:

üöß A sandbox of ideas and engineering

üîÅ Built by iteration: brake, fail, fix, retry

üôã In need of true believers who can build with us

> **‚ö† Warning**
>
> We don't promise it will work tomorrow. But we are building it every day to make it work.
>
> - **If it works**: the credit belongs to _everyone who dared_ to try.
> - **If it fails**: we'll have _learned more_ than most systems ever attempt.
>
> This is not just software. It's a belief in what's possible.

ü§ù **Welcome to JamLiquor. Let's tinker toward something impossible.**
