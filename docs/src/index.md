## 🌟 Core Principles

JamLiquor is built on five non-negotiable principles. Each one is documented in its own dedicated page:

1. 🚀 [Lightweight by Design](./EDGE.md)
   Efficient at the edge. Designed for minimalism without compromise.

2. 🌐 [Real Decentralization](./NETWORK.md)
   No central backdoors. No soft capture. Just real distributed infrastructure.

3. 🧠 [Adaptability Through Inference](./AI.md)
   Embedded AI for adaptive behavior — edge-aware, context-smart.

4. 🔐 [Quantum Resistance](./PQC.md)
   Cryptography that outlives quantum threats. Built for a longer tomorrow.

5. 🧱 [Simplicity Is Strength](./ARCHITECTURE.md)
   Elegant, composable architecture. Complexity kills — simplicity scales.
