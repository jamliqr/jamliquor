# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create lightweight configuration options
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the lightweight mode for minimal resource usage
# Details:
Develop the `jamliquor-lite` extension module. Implement resource-efficient configurations for extremely constrained hardware. Create mechanisms to reduce memory and CPU usage while maintaining essential functionality. Optimize critical paths for performance on low-end devices. Implement configuration options for different hardware profiles.

# Test Strategy:
Test functionality on the most constrained target platforms (e.g., Milk-V Duo with 64MB RAM). Measure memory and CPU usage in different configurations. Verify that essential node functions work correctly in lightweight mode.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create jamliquor-lite module structure [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the foundational structure for the lightweight extension module
### Details:
Create the jamliquor-lite module with proper directory structure. Define the module's entry points and interfaces that will be compatible with the main application. Establish configuration schema for lightweight mode with parameters for memory limits, CPU usage caps, and feature toggles. Create initialization hooks that the main application will use to load the lightweight configuration when specified.

## 2. Implement memory optimization mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop techniques to reduce memory footprint in lightweight mode
### Details:
Create memory pooling for frequently allocated objects to reduce heap fragmentation. Implement lazy loading for non-critical components. Add configuration options to limit cache sizes and reduce in-memory data structures. Develop a memory monitoring system that can dynamically adjust resource usage based on system constraints. Create garbage collection optimization strategies specific to lightweight mode.

## 3. Implement CPU usage optimizations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop mechanisms to reduce CPU utilization while maintaining core functionality
### Details:
Create throttling mechanisms for background processes. Implement batching for I/O operations to reduce context switching. Add configuration options for reducing processing frequency of non-critical tasks. Optimize critical code paths through profiling and targeted improvements. Implement simplified algorithms for resource-intensive operations that trade some accuracy for performance on constrained hardware.

## 4. Create hardware profile configurations [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Develop preset configurations for different hardware capabilities
### Details:
Define 3-4 hardware profiles (e.g., 'minimal', 'low', 'moderate') with appropriate settings for each optimization parameter. Create a detection mechanism to suggest appropriate profile based on available system resources. Implement a configuration UI for users to select and customize profiles. Develop documentation explaining the tradeoffs of each profile. Create automated tests to verify performance characteristics of each profile on reference hardware configurations.
