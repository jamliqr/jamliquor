# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement monitoring and configuration interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Create user interface for node setup, monitoring, and module management
# Details:
Develop a minimal configuration interface for the node. Implement clear module activation/deactivation controls. Create performance and resource usage indicators. Design user flows for node setup, module selection, and network participation. Ensure the interface is accessible and usable for all target user personas (Blockchain Enthusiasts, Edge Computing Developers, Cryptography Researchers, Decentralization Advocates).

# Test Strategy:
Conduct usability testing with representatives from each user persona. Verify all key user flows work correctly. Test configuration changes and ensure they take effect properly. Validate that performance monitoring accurately reflects system state.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and implement core dashboard layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the foundational UI structure for the monitoring and configuration interface with responsive design principles
### Details:
Develop the main dashboard layout with navigation components, sidebar for module selection, and content areas for different views. Implement responsive design to ensure usability across device sizes. Create reusable UI components for status indicators, buttons, and information panels. Design should accommodate all planned features including node setup, monitoring panels, and module management. Follow accessibility guidelines to ensure the interface is usable by all target personas.

## 2. Implement node setup and configuration workflows [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create user flows and interfaces for initial node setup and ongoing configuration
### Details:
Develop step-by-step setup wizard for new node initialization. Create forms for network configuration, security settings, and connection parameters. Implement validation for configuration inputs with clear error messaging. Design and implement settings pages for modifying node configuration after initial setup. Include help text and documentation links to assist users of varying technical backgrounds. Test workflows with representatives from each target persona to ensure clarity and usability.

## 3. Build module management interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create interfaces for viewing, activating, deactivating, and configuring modules
### Details:
Implement a module browser showing all available modules with status indicators. Create toggle controls for module activation/deactivation with confirmation dialogs. Develop detailed module information views showing dependencies, resource requirements, and configuration options. Implement module-specific configuration forms that dynamically adjust based on module requirements. Add search and filtering capabilities to help users find modules. Include visual indicators for module compatibility and dependency relationships.

## 4. Implement monitoring dashboards and alerts [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create real-time monitoring interfaces for node performance, resource usage, and network status
### Details:
Develop real-time charts and graphs for CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. Implement network status indicators showing connections, peers, and synchronization status. Create module-specific performance metrics panels that display when relevant modules are active. Design and implement an alerting system for resource constraints, network issues, or security concerns. Add historical data views for analyzing performance over time. Ensure all monitoring components update in real-time with minimal performance impact on the node itself.
