# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop AI-adaptive node capabilities
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create TinyML-based inference capabilities for node adaptation
# Details:
Implement the `jamliquor-ai` extension module. Integrate TinyML framework for edge inference. Develop models for network condition analysis and adaptation. Create mechanisms for the node to dynamically respond to changing conditions. Implement resource-efficient inference that works within edge hardware constraints.

# Test Strategy:
Test inference capabilities with sample network condition data. Verify adaptation mechanisms work correctly. Measure resource usage during inference to ensure it meets edge hardware constraints. Test with various network scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create jamliquor-ai extension module scaffold [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the basic structure for the jamliquor-ai extension module with proper integration points to the core system
### Details:
Create the module directory structure with proper package configuration. Implement the module entry point that registers with the core system. Define the API interfaces for AI capabilities that will be exposed to other components. Set up configuration handling for AI parameters. Include basic logging and diagnostics capabilities for the AI subsystem.

## 2. Integrate TinyML framework for edge inference [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Select and integrate an appropriate TinyML framework that can run efficiently on edge devices
### Details:
Evaluate and select a TinyML framework (e.g., TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime) based on performance benchmarks on target hardware. Create wrapper classes that abstract the framework-specific details. Implement model loading and initialization functions. Set up memory-efficient tensor allocation and management. Add utilities for quantization and optimization of models for edge deployment.

## 3. Develop network condition analysis models [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Create and train lightweight ML models that can analyze network conditions using limited resources
### Details:
Define feature extraction from network metrics (latency, packet loss, bandwidth). Implement data preprocessing pipelines optimized for edge devices. Train and optimize small-footprint models (decision trees, tiny neural networks) for network condition classification. Convert models to TinyML format with quantization. Create a model evaluation system to measure inference accuracy and resource usage on target hardware.

## 4. Implement dynamic adaptation mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3
### Description: Create the systems that allow nodes to adapt their behavior based on AI inference results
### Details:
Develop an adaptation policy framework that maps inference results to concrete actions. Implement hooks into networking stack to modify routing, caching, and transmission parameters. Create feedback loops that measure the effectiveness of adaptations. Implement gradual adaptation mechanisms to prevent oscillation. Add safeguards to revert to default behavior if adaptations cause performance degradation.

## 5. Optimize resource usage for edge constraints [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Fine-tune the AI subsystem to operate within strict resource constraints of edge hardware
### Details:
Profile memory and CPU usage during inference. Implement dynamic model loading/unloading based on device capabilities. Create adaptive inference scheduling based on system load. Optimize tensor operations for specific edge hardware (using hardware acceleration where available). Implement power-aware inference that adjusts precision based on battery status. Add configuration options to balance inference quality vs. resource usage.
