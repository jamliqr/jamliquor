# üß™ Cleanroom Policy for JamLiquor

## Overview
JamLiquor is a **cleanroom Rust implementation** of the JAM Protocol. It has been built from scratch to ensure:

- JAM Prize eligibility
- Legal and ethical separation from existing implementations
- Trust in code provenance and conformance

This document outlines how we ensure our cleanroom standards.

---

## ‚úÖ What Cleanroom Means in JamLiquor
A cleanroom implementation ensures:
- **No direct copying** of JAM source code (e.g. from ParityTech or Web3 Foundation repositories)
- **Independent reimplementation** based on publicly available specifications
- **Transparent commit history**, publicly timestamped
- **Documented references** and architecture reasoning

---

## üîê Cleanroom Principles
1. **No source reuse** from:
   - Parity's JAM reference clients
   - Polkadot node source code
   - Any proprietary JAM-related implementation

2. **Allowed materials**:
   - JAM Graypaper (https://github.com/gavofyork/graypaper)
   - JAM Prize specs (https://hackmd.io/@polkadot/jamprize)
   - JAM-related public blog posts (e.g. kianenigma, parity forums)
   - Official documentation and diagrams (HackMD, GitHub wikis)

3. **Codebase boundaries**:
   - All core components (`importer`, `authorer`, `vm`) are written independently
   - Any reused crates are open-source and third-party (e.g. `blake3`, `dilithium`, `tinyml`)
   - Modular extensions are explicitly separated from JAM core logic

4. **Contributors declare compliance**:
   - All contributors agree to cleanroom principles
   - PRs involving potentially derivative logic are flagged and reviewed

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Rust toolchain (1.75.0+)
   - Configure development tools:
     ```bash
     rustup component add clippy rustfmt
     cargo install cargo-audit cargo-tarpaulin
     ```
   - Set up git hooks for pre-commit checks

2. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Rustfmt for formatting
   - Clippy for linting
   - cargo-audit for security
   - cargo-tarpaulin for coverage

3. **Development Workflow**
   - Branch naming: `feature/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, `refactor/`
   - Commit message format: `type(scope): description`
   - Local testing before PR submission

---

1. **Pre-Review Checklist**
   - All tests passing
   - Documentation updated
   - Cleanroom compliance verified
   - No linter warnings
   - Test coverage maintained

2. **Review Stages**
   - Initial automated checks
   - Primary reviewer assessment
   - Secondary reviewer for core changes
   - Final cleanroom compliance check

3. **Review Focus Areas**
   - Code correctness
   - Performance implications
   - Security considerations
   - Documentation quality
   - Test coverage
   - Cleanroom compliance

4. **Approval Requirements**
   - Two approving reviews

   - Security audit completion

2. **Release Process**
   - Create release branch
   - Run release test suite
   - Generate release artifacts
   - Sign release binaries
   - Update documentation
   - Tag release commit

3. **Post-Release**

---

## üìù Documentation Trail
To support auditing and open collaboration:
- All modules include top-level comments referencing JAM specs
- Significant design decisions are logged in `docs/decisions/`
- Any changes in architectural interpretation are documented

---

## ‚öñ License & Legal
JamLiquor is licensed under **GPL-3.0**, with:
- Explicit declaration of cleanroom intent
- No reuse of GPL-incompatible sources

We welcome external audits, JAM Prize assessments, and community reviews to validate this policy.
