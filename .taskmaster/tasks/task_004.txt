# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate PolkaVM Backend
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the RISC-V execution environment with PolkaVM
# Details:
Integrate PolkaVM for smart contract execution. Implement 64-bit JIT support for performance optimization. Create JAM-compatible syscall interface for contract interaction with the node. Develop the RISC-V execution backend with appropriate memory and performance constraints for edge hardware.

# Test Strategy:
Test execution of sample contracts on the PolkaVM backend. Verify syscall interface functionality. Benchmark execution performance on target edge hardware platforms. Ensure compatibility with JAM Protocol specifications.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up PolkaVM core integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate the core PolkaVM RISC-V execution environment into the project codebase
### Details:
Add PolkaVM as a dependency to the project. Create a wrapper module that initializes the VM and provides basic execution capabilities. Implement memory allocation and management for the VM context. Set up the basic execution flow for RISC-V programs with proper error handling and state management. This subtask focuses on getting the core VM running without JAM-specific functionality.

## 2. Implement 64-bit JIT compilation support [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Enable and optimize the Just-In-Time compilation for 64-bit execution environments
### Details:
Configure PolkaVM's JIT compilation settings for 64-bit architectures. Implement performance profiling to identify hotspots in contract execution. Add memory optimizations specific to the JIT compiler. Create benchmarking tools to measure execution performance. Tune JIT parameters for optimal performance on edge hardware. This subtask should result in measurable performance improvements over the baseline implementation.

## 3. Develop JAM-compatible syscall interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create the system call interface that allows RISC-V contracts to interact with the JAM node
### Details:
Define the syscall ABI (Application Binary Interface) that contracts will use to communicate with the node. Implement handlers for each syscall type including storage access, network operations, cryptographic functions, and other JAM-specific operations. Create a mapping layer between RISC-V register conventions and JAM's internal data structures. Implement proper permission and security checks for all syscalls. Add comprehensive logging and debugging capabilities for syscall operations.

## 4. Optimize execution environment for edge hardware [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Fine-tune the RISC-V backend for resource-constrained edge devices
### Details:
Implement memory usage constraints and monitoring to prevent excessive resource consumption. Create adaptive execution strategies based on available system resources. Optimize contract loading and unloading to minimize memory footprint. Implement caching mechanisms for frequently executed contracts. Add resource throttling capabilities to prevent denial-of-service scenarios. Perform comprehensive testing on representative edge hardware to validate performance and stability. Document hardware requirements and performance characteristics.
