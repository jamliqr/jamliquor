# Simplicity is Strength

> Complexity is fragility. Simplicity is power.

JamLiquor is intentionally minimalist‚Äînot because we lack ambition, but because **trustless systems should be understandable**, extensible, and verifiable by anyone.

## Why Simplicity Matters in Blockchain

Modern blockchain stacks suffer from:
- üåÄ Recursive rollups
- üß© Layered bridges
- üß† Unverifiable ZK complexity
- üõ† Inaccessible tooling for most developers

> If your blockchain needs a PhD to audit, it's not secure.

JamLiquor chooses another path:
- **1 runtime** (JAM-compatible)
- **1 execution model** (PolkaVM)
- **1 state tree** (unified JAM model)
- **Modular extensions** (not embedded complexity)

## Code Design Philosophy
JamLiquor follows:
- üß† **Rust-first ergonomics** (clear, type-safe interfaces)
- üîç **Modular crates**, no god-objects
- üì¶ **Small units of code**, each ~<500 LOC
- üß™ **Testable in isolation**, not just integrated

Every line is:
- Explicit
- Auditable
- Justified by JAM specs or clean extensions

## What We Avoid
- ‚ùå Recursive rollups
- ‚ùå Multi-layer fraud proofs
- ‚ùå Hidden gas accounting
- ‚ùå Hardcoded validators
- ‚ùå WASM-only obscurity

> Complexity is technical debt in disguise.

## Summary
JamLiquor is architected for simplicity:
- ‚ú≥Ô∏è Easy to audit
- ‚ú≥Ô∏è Easy to run
- ‚ú≥Ô∏è Easy to modify

It is not just a lab experiment. It's aiming to be a working node for humans.

**Simplicity scales. Simplicity survives.**
