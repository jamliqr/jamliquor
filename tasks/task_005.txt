# Task ID: 5
# Title: Create modular extension system architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement the pluggable module system for extensions
# Details:
Develop a flexible extension system that allows for pluggable modules. Create interfaces and hooks for runtime extensions. Implement module loading, activation, and deactivation mechanisms. Design configuration system for extensions. Ensure minimal overhead when extensions are not in use to maintain lightweight operation.

# Test Strategy:
Create test extensions to verify the module system works correctly. Test loading and unloading of modules at runtime. Verify that disabled extensions don't impact performance. Ensure proper error handling for module failures.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define extension system interfaces and contracts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core interfaces and contracts that all extensions must implement
### Details:
Design and implement the base interfaces that define how extensions interact with the core system. This should include: (1) IExtension interface with lifecycle methods like initialize(), activate(), deactivate(), and dispose(); (2) Extension metadata interface for version, dependencies, and capabilities; (3) Extension context interface that provides controlled access to core system functionality; (4) Event interfaces for extensions to subscribe to system events. Use abstract classes where appropriate to provide default implementations. Document each interface thoroughly with examples.

## 2. Implement extension registry and lifecycle management [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the central registry that manages extension instances and their lifecycle
### Details:
Develop an ExtensionRegistry class that maintains the collection of available and active extensions. Implement methods for registering, loading, activating, deactivating, and unloading extensions. Include dependency resolution to ensure extensions are loaded in the correct order. Implement proper error handling for extension lifecycle operations. Add events for extension state changes. Create unit tests to verify the registry correctly manages extension lifecycles and handles error conditions appropriately.

## 3. Build extension discovery and loading mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create the system for discovering and dynamically loading extension modules
### Details:
Implement an ExtensionLoader that can discover extensions from multiple sources (directories, packages, etc.). Create a plugin manifest format (JSON/YAML) that describes extension metadata. Implement dynamic module loading using appropriate techniques for the platform (e.g., dynamic imports in JS, reflection in Java/C#). Add validation of extension manifests and compatibility checking. Implement lazy-loading to minimize startup impact. Include extension isolation mechanisms to prevent one extension from breaking others. Add detailed logging for troubleshooting loading issues.

## 4. Design and implement extension configuration system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Create a system for extensions to define, store, and access configuration
### Details:
Implement an ExtensionConfigManager that handles reading and writing extension-specific configuration. Create schema validation for extension configurations. Implement configuration change notifications so extensions can react to changes. Design default configuration handling. Create configuration UI integration points for extensions to define their settings UI. Implement configuration versioning and migration for extension updates. Add configuration scoping (user vs. system). Ensure configurations are properly isolated between extensions.

## 5. Create extension communication and hook system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4
### Description: Implement mechanisms for extensions to communicate and extend core functionality
### Details:
Design and implement a hook system that allows the core application to expose extension points. Create an event bus for extensions to communicate with each other without direct dependencies. Implement service registration and discovery so extensions can provide and consume services. Add capability declarations so extensions can declare what they provide and require. Create an API for extensions to register UI components at predefined extension points. Implement performance monitoring to identify extensions that impact system performance. Add security boundaries to prevent extensions from accessing unauthorized functionality.
